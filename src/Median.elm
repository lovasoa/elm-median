module Median exposing (median)

{-| Compute the median of a list of comparable elements.

# Definition

A median element `m` of a list `l`
is **an element of the list** such that
the difference between the number of elements smaller than `m`
and the number of elements larger than `m` in `l` is minimal.

# Find a median

{-|
  Helper function.
  Takes a part of the list, the number of elements before the given part,
  the number of elements after, and returns the median if there are
  elements in the given part of the list.
  Otherwise, it returns `Nothing`.

{-| Returns a median element.

The implementation has an average complexity of O(log(N)),
and a worst-case complexity of O(N^2) (when the list is sorted).
